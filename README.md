# 🔎 Realtime-Search Box

This application allows users to search for an article in the search box, saving their searches based on the user's IP address.

# 🚀 Features
- Allows users to search for articles
- Displays articles searched per user

# 🛠 Main Technologies
- `Ruby on Rails`
- `JavaScript`
- `CSS`
- `RSpec`

## 📄 Process

- I began by listing what methods this application would need to function as expected.
- Secondly, I created the rails app locally and implemented the methods that I had come up with
- Next, I prepared the database that was supposed to collect and save the searched articles
- I later conducted tests to ensure that the application handled the possible search scenarios correctly.
- Finally, I deployed the application to Render and tested to see if the IP addresses were fetched correctly in production.

# How it can be improved

- The applications may need to be responsive to adhere to both small and large screens
- Implement caching and other performance optimization techniques to ensure the application loads quickly and provides a smooth user experience.

## 🐛 Current Bug
- I don't have any known bugs to report as of this moment.
